# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for database operations.  The provided `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data from a database.  However, it fails to handle errors gracefully, leading to potential crashes and a poor user experience.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, ensuring robustness and informative responses to the client.

## Problem

The `bug.js` example omits crucial error handling when interacting with the database. If a database error occurs (e.g., connection failure, invalid user ID), the error is silently logged to the console, and no informative response is sent to the client. This can lead to unexpected behavior, application crashes, or confusing responses for the user.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` example demonstrates best practices for handling database errors in Express.js.  It implements the following:

* **Explicit Error Handling:** Uses try...catch blocks to handle potential errors during database operations.
* **Informative Error Responses:** Sends appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 for server errors, 404 for not found) with informative error messages to the client.
* **Centralized Error Handling (Optional):**  For larger applications, consider using a centralized error handling middleware for better maintainability.
